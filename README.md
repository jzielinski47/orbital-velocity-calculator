## Overview
The Orbital Velocity Calculator is a simple <b>.NET Framework-based Windows Forms application</b> developed as a part of my university coursework at [Cracow University of Technology](www.pk.edu.pl). This project was created to fulfill the requirements of a <b>.NET Framework assignment</b>, which focused on implementing engineering-related concepts. It combines programming techniques with the principles of orbital mechanics, inspired by my interest in space exploration and games like Kerbal Space Program.

This application calculates orbital parameters for celestial bodies, offering users an interactive and visual experience to explore concepts like:
- Orbital Velocity
- Escape Velocity
- Gravitational Force
- Orbital Energy
- Orbital Period

## Features
Core Functionalities
- Predefined Celestial Bodies:
  - Choose from planets like Earth, Mars, and Jupiter or input custom values.
  - Predefined data includes mass, radius, and illustrative images of celestial bodies.
- Custom Input Mode:
  - Define custom values for celestial body mass and radius.
- Orbital Calculations:
  - Orbital velocity.
  - Escape velocity.  
  - Orbital energy.
  - Orbital period.
- Dynamic Visualization:
  - Plots graphs of orbital velocity and escape velocity as a function of orbital altitude.
  - Highlights the current satellite height with a vertical marker.
- File Operations:
  - Save satellite parameters to a file in CSV format.
  - Load satellite parameters from a previously saved file.
- Error Handling:
  - Provides user feedback for invalid or incomplete inputs.
- Interactive Interface:
  - View images and details of celestial bodies directly in the application.

## Technologies Used
<b>Programming Language:</b> C#

**Framework:** .NET Framework

**UI Library:** Windows Forms

**Data Visualization:** Windows Forms Data Visualization Charting Library

## Background
This project is part of a .NET Framework coursework assignment, requiring the implementation of specific functionalities such as:

- Error handling,
- Custom drawing methods,
- Modular class design,
- User-provided data handling,
- File I/O operations.

The assignment was designed to encourage creativity, and I decided to create an engineering-inspired application focusing on space mechanics. The project exceeds the basic requirements by offering advanced visualization, improved UI/UX, and additional celestial body data integration.
